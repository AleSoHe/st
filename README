# Simple Terminal (st)

This is a fork from suckless's **st**

> st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less


## Requirements
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


## Installation
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

## What's changed in this fork?

This is my personal build, so I added or will add patches to match my likes.
Right now, the changes are:
    - Default size: 14 (as I am getting blinder)
    - Colorscheme Dracula (Patch)
    - Alpha for transparency (Patch)

## Running st

If using with my other build of _dwm_, just run with Mod+Shift+Return
